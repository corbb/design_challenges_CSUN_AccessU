## Examples repository or the 2019 CSUN presentation: Robust, Semantic Solutions to Modern Design Challenges



## Clone the repo
  * Clone the repository using the command `git clone`

## Install Dependencies
  * Ensure you've installed [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
  * command `npm install` to install all dependencies for the project

## Sass watch
  * Start sass watch with command `npm run sass`
  * When you save changes in any scss file in the sass folder the CSS will compile to the common folder.
  * Note: if you add a scss file in the sass folder you may have to restart your sass watch script in order to recognize changes in the new file.

## Run the index file on localhost
  * I like to use python simple http server `python -m http.server 8080`
  * Open your browser to localhost:8080 and you should see the index file.


TODO!!
- [ ] Pull blogpost css into more consise scss file. Components etc getting annoying showcasing different brands
- [ ] Back buttons, nav through slides
- [ ] Home button to get back to index
